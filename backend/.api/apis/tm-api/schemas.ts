This delay has become a hot topic of discussion in the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nNEAR's decision to back out of an $11 million stablecoin redemption deal with Wintermute has caught attention. The reasons behind this move are yet to be revealed, creating speculation within the industry.\n\nRenowned industry figure John Deaton has predicted that Bitcoin ETFs may potentially receive approval in the United States by late 2023.
